## Overview
Given a day and a half to produce educational material in the medium of our choice. For this project 
I had young coders in mind, who would have some experience with JavaScript. The main idea was to promote TypeScript as a tool they could start using now to help avoid type errors. It expanded slightly into a basic introduction and laying out a couple of options to start trying TypeScript without having to be a master of the command line.
  
## Built With

## The Process
I started out brainstorming the facts about Typescript and potential mediums for my project to get the ball rolling. I initially wanted to make a video, but having  had  a play around with a few different video editing tools I decided that within the time limits I was better off using technologies that I had some experience of. During that process though, I had become sure that I wanted to incorporate animation to keep the attention of younger viewers. One technology we became quite familiar with early on in the School of Code Bootcamp was Scratch, which is easy to use for making animations. It was also a good choice as it was a tool that I thought would be familiar to the target audience. If you've never played around with it, I highly recommend it as a learning tool and hobby! You can do a lot more with it than it might first seem and it's brilliant for kids to get used to the idea of coding with components.

I made a rough animation of my own and thought about how I would display it. I didn't want to spend my entire time animating, so I looked at the initial Story I had come up with and tried to tie it to what I had so far. My first idea was to follow a programmer as they transform from dinosaur to agile bird, freed from type errors! That was far too ambitious! I went with a reducted version for the cartoon, lots of small bugs causing a nuisance to the developer (a charming dinosaur) when using JS vs the developer free to work on more abstracted ideas with TypeScript. Animation time reduced, great, but now where was the education coming in?
